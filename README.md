# ♭conductor

Orchestrate your AI coding agents across your own machines — local-first, cloud-optional.

Your best ideas don't always happen at your desk. With be-conductor, you can start an agent session from your phone and let it run on your workstation, GPU box, or dev machine. AI agents run for minutes — sometimes hours — and then stall on a single question. If you're not at that terminal, the session idles until you return.

be-conductor keeps them moving. It runs entirely on your machines. No remote backend. No vendor dependency. It wraps terminal sessions in a lightweight server and exposes them through a web dashboard you can open from your phone, tablet, or laptop. Pair it with [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) and you get secure access to all your machines — no port forwarding, no VPN setup, just works.

## What It Looks Like

| Desktop | Mobile | Mobile (keyboard) |
|---------|--------|--------------------|
| <a href="data/desktop-split.png"><img src="data/desktop-split.png" alt="Desktop — split view" width="420"></a> | <a href="data/mobile-split.jpg"><img src="data/mobile-split.jpg" alt="Mobile — split view" width="150"></a> | <a href="data/mobile-keyboard.jpg"><img src="data/mobile-keyboard.jpg" alt="Mobile — keyboard" width="150"></a> |

`<agent>` is the command to run. Some examples:

| Agent | Command |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `be-conductor run claude research` |
| Gemini CLI | `be-conductor run gemini research` |
| OpenCode | `be-conductor run opencode backend` |
| Codex CLI | `be-conductor run codex backend` |
| Aider | `be-conductor run aider refactor` |
| Goose | `be-conductor run goose api` |
| GitHub Copilot | `be-conductor run copilot chat` |
| Amp | `be-conductor run amp feature` |
| Forge | `be-conductor run forge pair` |
| Custom (allowlisted) | `be-conductor run python3 train` |

```
Start agents                Leave your desk         Answer from anywhere
──────────────              ───────────────         ────────────────────
be-conductor run <agent> dev   Go to a meeting.        Open dashboard on phone.
be-conductor run <agent> test  Grab coffee.            See all sessions.
be-conductor run <agent> api   Sit on the couch.       Type a response. Done.
                                                    Agent keeps going.
```

You can also start new sessions directly from the web dashboard — pick an agent, name the session, and hit Run. No terminal needed. When you're back at your computer, attach to any running session from the terminal with `be-conductor attach <name>`.

Sessions survive disconnects. Close the browser, reopen it later — everything is still there. When an agent session exits with a resume token (e.g. Claude Code's `--resume`), be-conductor captures it and lets you resume the conversation later — even after a reboot.

## How It Works

```

                      │
              Browser Dashboard
          (connects to both servers)
```

Each process runs in a PTY on your machine. Output goes into a rolling in-memory buffer. When a browser connects, it gets the full buffer first, then live output over WebSocket. The dashboard connects directly to each server — no proxy, no hub. Each server stays independent.

## What You Can Run

be-conductor works with any interactive terminal process. The dashboard ships with presets for common AI agents, but you can run anything from the CLI:

- **AI coding agents** — Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Goose, Amp, Aider, Forge, Cursor Agent
- **Training jobs** — long-running GPU training with live output
- **Builds and test suites** — compilation, CI pipelines, test runs
- **Any terminal process** — if it runs in a terminal, be-conductor can manage it

### Adding commands to the allowlist

The dashboard can only launch commands from the allowlist. The CLI is unrestricted.

**From the dashboard (recommended):** Open the hamburger menu → **Settings**. The dialog is organized into tabs — **General** (server info, auth token, limits), **Agents** (command allowlist), **Directories** (default paths), **Servers** (multi-machine management), and **Notifications** (browser/webhook alerts). Admin tabs (General, Agents, Directories) are visible on localhost or when `BE_CONDUCTOR_TOKEN` is set. Add, edit, or remove commands and click **Save**. Changes take effect immediately on all connected clients — no restart needed. Settings are stored in `~/.be-conductor/config.yaml`.

**From the config file:** Edit `~/.be-conductor/config.yaml` directly (created on first save from Settings):

```yaml
allowed_commands:
  - command: "claude"
    label: "Claude Code"
  - command: "python3"
    label: "Python"
```

Optional fields for advanced behavior:

```yaml
  - command: "my-agent"
    label: "My Agent"
    resume_pattern: "--resume\\s+(\\S+)"    # regex to capture resume token from output
    resume_flag: "--resume"                 # flag used when resuming (token-based)
    resume_command: "my-agent --continue"   # fixed command for resume (command-based)
    stop_sequence: ["\x03", "/exit", "\r"]  # graceful stop keystrokes
```

Use `resume_pattern` + `resume_flag` for agents that print a resume token on exit (e.g. Claude Code). Use `resume_command` for agents that manage their own session history (e.g. Gemini, OpenCode, Goose). Don't set both.

After editing the file, restart the server: `be-conductor restart`.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** — check with `python3 --version` (or `py --version` on Windows)
- **Git** — to clone the repository
- **Tailscale** (optional, for remote access) — install on your workstation and your phone, tablet, or laptop. Sign in with the same account on all devices. See [tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com/)

## Install

### Linux / [macOS](docs/MACOS.md)

#### One-line install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/somniacs/be-conductor/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

#### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/somniacs/be-conductor.git
cd be-conductor
./install.sh
```

If the command is not found after install, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`).

The installer checks for Python 3.10+, installs [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) if needed, and offers to set up autostart (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS).

### [Windows](docs/WINDOWS.md)

Requires Windows 10 Build 1809+ or Windows 11 (for ConPTY support).

#### One-line install (recommended)

```powershell
irm https://github.com/somniacs/be-conductor/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

#### From source

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/somniacs/be-conductor.git
cd be-conductor
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

The installer checks for Python 3.10+, installs [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) if needed, and offers to set up autostart via Task Scheduler.

<details>
<summary>Manual install (without install script)</summary>

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/somniacs/be-conductor.git
cd be-conductor
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/somniacs/be-conductor.git
cd be-conductor
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

</details>

### Updating

The dashboard shows a notification when a new version is available. To update, run the one-liner again or `./install.sh` from a cloned repo. On Windows, run `install.ps1` again. Your settings (`~/.be-conductor/config.yaml`), sessions, and uploads are preserved — only the application code is replaced.

### Uninstall

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/somniacs/be-conductor/releases/latest/download/uninstall.sh | bash
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
irm https://github.com/somniacs/be-conductor/releases/latest/download/uninstall.ps1 | iex
```

This stops the server, removes autostart configs, uninstalls the package, and asks whether to keep or remove your data.

## Usage

### Start sessions

```bash
# Start one session (server auto-starts in background)
be-conductor run <agent> research

# Start more
be-conductor run <agent> coding
be-conductor run <agent> review
```

Open the dashboard in your browser — locally at `http://127.0.0.1:7777`, or from any device on your Tailscale network at `http://100.x.x.x:7777` (your Tailscale IP).

Want the dashboard always available? See [Auto-Start on Boot](docs/autostart.md) for systemd, launchd, and Task Scheduler setup.

### Git worktree isolation

When AI agents write code, they change files in your working directory — which can conflict with your own uncommitted work or other running agents. be-conductor solves this with **git worktree isolation**: each session gets its own branch and working copy, so agents never step on each other or on your work. This works with any agent — Claude Code, Aider, Codex, Goose, Copilot, or any custom command.

```bash
# Start a session in an isolated worktree
be-conductor run -w claude refactor-auth

# Start another — both run in parallel on separate branches
be-conductor run -w claude add-tests
```

Each worktree session:
- Gets a fresh branch based on your current HEAD
- Runs in its own directory (under `.be-conductor-worktrees/` in the repo)
- Auto-commits changes when the session stops or before a merge
- Shows branch name and commit count in the dashboard sidebar

The worktree lifecycle is simple: **work → merge → repeat → delete**.

```bash
# See all worktrees and their status
be-conductor worktree list

# Merge changes back (squash, merge, or rebase)
be-conductor worktree merge refactor-auth --strategy squash

# Or discard if you don't want the changes
be-conductor worktree discard add-tests

# Clean up stale worktrees
be-conductor worktree gc
```

**Merging is non-destructive.** When you merge, the worktree stays alive. You can resume the session, make more changes, and merge again — as many times as needed. The merge button only appears when there are new commits to merge. When you're fully done, delete the worktree with the × button.

You can also manage worktrees directly from the dashboard. The sidebar shows a git-branch icon for worktree sessions with the branch name and commit count. Stopped worktree sessions show three buttons:

- **▶ Resume** — reopen the session and keep working
- **↻ Merge** — opens a merge dialog with diff preview, conflict detection, and strategy picker (squash/merge/rebase). Click "Show diff" for a fullscreen diff viewer with file sidebar, keyboard navigation, and font zoom
- **× Delete** — remove the worktree and its branch

Enable worktree mode by toggling the worktree switch in the new-session dialog (only appears in git repositories).

### Multi-machine setup

be-conductor supports connecting to multiple machines from a single dashboard. Each machine runs its own independent be-conductor server. The dashboard in your browser connects to all of them directly — no central hub or proxy needed.

**1. Install and start be-conductor on each machine:**

```bash
# On workstation
be-conductor run <agent> research
be-conductor run <agent> coding

# On GPU box (install be-conductor there too)
be-conductor run <agent> train
```

**2. Add machines to the dashboard:**

Open the dashboard on any device, then hamburger menu → **Servers**.

- **Tailscale device picker** — your online Tailscale devices appear in a dropdown. Select one and click Add. This is the easiest way.
- **Manual URL** — paste `http://100.x.x.x:7777` (or a MagicDNS name) for any machine on your network.
- **QR code** — run `be-conductor qr` on a machine, then use **Link Device** in the dashboard to scan it.

**How it works:**

The dashboard polls each server independently for sessions and connects via separate WebSockets. The sidebar groups sessions by machine with connection status indicators:

```
● Workstation (local)
  research
  coding
● GPU Box
  train
```

You can open terminals from different machines side by side in split view — one panel showing your workstation session, another showing your GPU box, both live.

**What happens when a machine goes offline:**

The dashboard detects the disconnect within seconds. Sessions from that machine disappear from the sidebar and any open terminal panels for it close automatically. When the machine comes back, sessions reappear.

**Persistence:**

Added machines are saved in your browser's localStorage. Refresh the page or close and reopen — your server list is preserved. Each browser/device maintains its own list independently.

### Session resume

When an agent exits and prints a resume token — like Claude Code's `--resume <session-id>` — be-conductor captures it from the terminal output automatically. The session stays in the sidebar as **resumable** with a play button. Click it (or run `be-conductor resume <name>` from the terminal) and be-conductor starts a new session with the original command plus the resume flag, picking up where you left off.

Agents that manage their own session history — like Codex (`codex resume`) and Copilot (`copilot --resume`) — are always marked as resumable when they exit. Clicking the play button launches the agent's built-in resume command.

Resume tokens are persisted to disk (`~/.be-conductor/sessions/`), so they survive server restarts and machine reboots. Power-cycle your laptop, start be-conductor again, and the resumable session is still there.

If you don't need a resumable session, dismiss it with the **×** button — a confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion.

### Discover and observe external sessions

AI agent sessions started outside be-conductor — in IDEs, other terminals, or standalone tools — are automatically discovered and shown in the Resume tab's browse list.

be-conductor scans local session stores for **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Copilot CLI**, **Gemini CLI**, and **Goose**. Each session shows its name/slug, project path, branch, agent badge, and recency. Sessions running in an IDE are marked with a live badge. Use the **agent filter dropdown** to narrow the list to a specific agent.

- **Resume a closed session** — select it from the list, give it a name, and click **Resume**. be-conductor launches the agent-specific resume command (e.g. `claude --resume`, `codex resume`, `copilot --resume`) in a PTY.
- **Observe a live session** — select a running session and click **Observe**. A read-only panel opens showing the conversation in real time with agent-specific formatting (user messages, assistant responses, tool calls — all color-coded). The Observe button is hidden for agents whose sessions aren't observable (Gemini, Goose).

Liveness is detected via IDE lock files (`~/.claude/ide/*.lock`, `~/.copilot/ide/*.lock`).

> **Warning:** Do not resume a session that is still active in an IDE. Session files are single-writer — resuming in be-conductor while the IDE is still using it can cause corruption. be-conductor blocks resume for sessions it detects as live, but the guard is best-effort. When in doubt, close the IDE session first.

**Creating sessions on remote machines:**

Click **+ New** in the sidebar. When multiple machines are connected, a **Machine** dropdown appears at the top of the form. Select the target machine, pick a command and directory (fetched from that machine's config), and click Run. The session starts on the remote machine and opens in a terminal panel.

**Single-server mode:**

When only one server is configured (the default), the dashboard looks and works exactly as a standalone single-machine setup. No server group headers, no machine selector — zero visual overhead.

### Remote access from another device

This requires [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) on both your workstation and your phone, tablet, or laptop.

**1. Start be-conductor on your workstation** (if not already running):

```bash
be-conductor run <agent> research
```

**2. Open on your other device:**

Option A — run `be-conductor qr` to show a scannable QR code:

```bash
be-conductor qr
```

Option B — use the dashboard's **Servers** dialog (hamburger menu → Servers) to see Tailscale devices and add them.

Option C — find your Tailscale IP and type the URL:

```bash
tailscale ip -4
# 100.x.x.x
```

Then open `http://100.x.x.x:7777` on your phone.

Done. Full terminal access to all sessions from your phone — type prompts, view output, create or kill sessions. Add more machines from Settings → Servers.

### Using Tailscale MagicDNS names

Tailscale assigns each device a [MagicDNS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns) name like `my-workstation.tailnet-name.ts.net`. You can use these instead of IP addresses:

```
http://my-workstation.tailnet-name.ts.net:7777
```

To find your machine's name:

```bash
tailscale status
# or check the be-conductor dashboard: Settings → Servers → "This server"
```

The Servers tab in Settings shows your machine's MagicDNS name, Tailscale IP, and hostname — all fetched from the `/info` endpoint. MagicDNS names are easier to remember and don't change when IPs rotate.

### Why remote access works

Tailscale creates a private network between your devices using WireGuard. Only your devices can reach the server. No ports exposed to the internet, no passwords, no setup beyond installing Tailscale. be-conductor binds to `0.0.0.0` so it's reachable on your Tailscale network without any extra configuration.

## Is It Safe?

Yes. be-conductor runs entirely on your machines — no cloud backend, no vendor account, no external service required. Output stays local; commands run locally; nothing is logged, queued, or controlled through any third-party service.

- **No cloud dependency** — runs on your workstation, GPU box, or air-gapped network. No API keys, no SaaS backend, zero cloud costs.
- **Local only** — the server binds to your machine. Without Tailscale (or another VPN), it is not reachable from outside your local network.
- **No authentication layer needed** — when using Tailscale, only devices signed into *your* Tailscale account can reach the server. The network itself is the firewall.
- **No data leaves your machine** — session output stays in an in-memory buffer on localhost. Nothing is logged to external services.
- **Restricted dashboard commands** — the web dashboard can only launch commands from a predefined allowlist. The CLI is unrestricted, but the browser cannot start arbitrary processes.
- **Localhost-only admin by default** — the Settings admin tabs and admin API (`/admin/settings`) are only accessible from `127.0.0.1`. Set `BE_CONDUCTOR_TOKEN` (or use Settings → General → Auth Token) to allow authenticated remote access.
- **No shell injection** — session input is sent through the PTY as keystrokes, not evaluated as shell commands by be-conductor itself.
- **Sanitized session names** — names are validated against a strict allowlist (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, max 64 chars) on both the frontend and backend to prevent path traversal or injection via crafted names.
- **Open source (MIT)** — the entire codebase is a single Python package and a single HTML file. Read it, audit it, fork it.

If you're running be-conductor on a shared network without Tailscale, anyone on that network can reach port 7777. In that case, use a firewall rule or bind to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0`.

## Dashboard

The web dashboard provides:

- **Multi-machine view** — connect to multiple be-conductor servers, sessions grouped by machine
- **Tailscale device picker** — discover and add machines from your Tailscale network
- **Session sidebar** — all sessions with focus tracking, grouped by machine in multi-server mode
- **Terminal panels** — full xterm.js rendering with colors, cursor, scrollback
- **Split view** — place panels Left, Right, Top, or Bottom with arbitrary nesting and draggable dividers
- **Keyboard input** — type directly into the terminal
- **New session** — create sessions on any connected machine with directory picker
- **Session resume** — exited sessions with a resume token show a play button; resume with one click
- **Multi-agent session discovery** — Resume tab discovers external sessions from Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, and Goose; filter by agent, resume closed sessions, or observe live ones in a read-only panel with agent-specific formatting
- **Kill confirmation** — stop sessions with a confirmation dialog
- **Color themes** — 6 presets per panel: Default, Dark, Mid, Bright, Bernstein, Green (retro CRT)
- **Font size controls** — per-panel `+` / `−` buttons, adaptive defaults for desktop and mobile
- **Idle notifications** — browser notification or webhook alert when a session is waiting for input. Supports Telegram, Discord, Slack, and custom webhooks. Webhook messages include a clickable deep link that opens the dashboard directly to the session. Smart suppression: webhooks only fire when you're not already looking at the dashboard (visibility-based, like read receipts). Setup guides: [Telegram](docs/notification_telegram.md), [Slack](docs/notification_slack.md)
- **Link Device** — QR code in the hamburger menu for opening the dashboard on another device
- **Git worktree isolation** — run any agent in an isolated git worktree; each gets its own branch and working copy, so parallel agents never conflict with each other or your work. Auto-commits before merge, non-destructive merge cycle (work → merge → resume → merge again → delete when done). Merge dialog with conflict detection, strategy picker (squash/merge/rebase), and fullscreen diff viewer with file sidebar, keyboard navigation (j/k, ↑/↓), and font zoom (+/−). Merge button only appears when there are commits to merge
- **Layout persistence** — open panels, split layout, and focus are saved to localStorage and restored on page reload; only panels with running sessions are restored
- **Settings panel** — tabbed dialog (General, Agents, Directories, Servers, Notifications) for managing auth tokens, allowed commands, directories, multi-server setup, webhook notifications, and more. Admin tabs visible on localhost or with token auth. Changes persist and propagate to all clients automatically
- **Cross-server notification sync** — view and sync webhook configuration across all connected machines from the Notifications tab
- **File upload** — drag and drop files onto the terminal (desktop), paste from clipboard (Ctrl+V), or tap the attachment button (mobile) to upload any file (images, PDFs, code, text, etc.); shows an upload dialog with progress, then lets you insert the file path into the terminal or copy it to clipboard. Uploaded files are auto-cleaned when the session ends
- **Mobile extra keys** — on-screen toolbar with ESC, TAB, arrows, CTRL, ALT, Page Up/Down, Home/End, and attachment button; appears above the virtual keyboard on touch devices, with collapsible drawer (state persisted)
- **Mobile touch scroll** — smooth native one-finger scrolling with hardware-accelerated momentum
- **Collapsible sidebar** — chevron toggle, auto-reopens when all panels close
- **Update notification** — on load, the dashboard checks GitHub for new releases. When a newer version exists, a small banner appears at the bottom of the sidebar. Click it to open the release page — no automatic download or install, you stay in full control
- **Auto-reconnect** — WebSocket reconnects automatically on disconnect
- **Minimum 80 columns** — narrow panels get horizontal scroll instead of reflow
- **Mobile-friendly** — responsive drawer, touch targets, dynamic viewport height, adaptive font size and scrollback. When the keyboard opens with multiple panels, the focused panel automatically goes full-screen; the split layout restores when the keyboard closes

## Agent Integration

be-conductor exposes a stable API that AI agents and automation tools can use to start, monitor, and interact with terminal sessions programmatically.

### Discovery

Check if the server is running and get connection details:

```bash
# CLI
be-conductor status --json
# → {"ok": true, "version": "0.3.18", "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:7777", ...}

# HTTP
curl http://127.0.0.1:7777/health
# → {"ok": true, "version": "0.3.18"}
```

The full OpenAPI spec is at `http://127.0.0.1:7777/openapi.json`.

### Start a session

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7777/sessions/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-agent", "command": "echo hello", "source": "cli"}'
```

The response includes a `ws_url` field for streaming output.

### Stream output (typed WebSocket)

Connect to the typed WebSocket endpoint for structured JSON messages:

```
ws://127.0.0.1:7777/sessions/my-agent/stream?typed=true
```

**Server sends:**
- `{"type": "stdout", "data": "..."}` — terminal output
- `{"type": "exit", "exit_code": 0}` — session ended
- `{"type": "ping"}` — keepalive

**Client sends:**
- `{"type": "input", "data": "..."}` — text input
- `{"type": "resize", "rows": 40, "cols": 120}` — resize terminal
- Plain text fallback: non-JSON text is treated as raw input

### Send input

```bash
# Text input
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7777/sessions/my-agent/input \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "yes\n"}'

# Key sequences
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7777/sessions/my-agent/input \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keys": ["CTRL+C"]}'
```

**Supported key names:** `ENTER`, `TAB`, `ESCAPE`, `BACKSPACE`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `CTRL+A`, `CTRL+C`, `CTRL+D`, `CTRL+E`, `CTRL+K`, `CTRL+L`, `CTRL+R`, `CTRL+U`, `CTRL+W`, `CTRL+Z`, `CTRL+\`

### Resume a session

List sessions, find one by name, and reconnect:

```bash
# List all sessions
curl http://127.0.0.1:7777/sessions

# Reconnect WebSocket to an existing session
ws://127.0.0.1:7777/sessions/my-agent/stream?typed=true
```

### Authentication

Set `BE_CONDUCTOR_TOKEN` as an environment variable before starting the server:

```bash
export BE_CONDUCTOR_TOKEN=my-secret-token
be-conductor serve
```

When set, all API requests (except `/health`) require a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-token" http://127.0.0.1:7777/sessions
```

WebSocket connections accept the token as a query parameter:

```
ws://127.0.0.1:7777/sessions/my-agent/stream?typed=true&token=my-secret-token
```

When no token is configured, the API is open (same as before).

## IDE Plugins

Manage be-conductor sessions without leaving your editor. Both plugins provide session creation, live session lists, worktree management, and session persistence across IDE restarts.

| IDE | Plugin | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **JetBrains** (CLion, IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, GoLand, Rider, …) | [tools/jetbrains/](tools/jetbrains/be-conductor-plugin/) | Settings → Plugins → gear → Install from Disk → select `.zip` |
| **VS Code** | [tools/vscode/](tools/vscode/be-conductor-vscode/) | `code --install-extension be-conductor-launcher-0.1.0.vsix` or copy to `~/.vscode/extensions/` |

### What the plugins do

- **New Session dialog** — pick an agent from the server's command list (fetched live), enter a session name, choose a working directory, and optionally enable git worktree isolation. Runs `be-conductor run <agent> <name>` in a new terminal tab
- **Session list** — live-updating sidebar panel showing all sessions with status (running, stopping, resumable, exited). Attach, stop, resume, or dismiss sessions with toolbar buttons or right-click context menu
- **Worktree management** — view diffs in the IDE's native diff viewer, merge worktrees (squash/merge/rebase), and finalize running worktree sessions — all from the sidebar
- **Session persistence** — sessions created in the IDE are tracked per workspace/project. When you close the IDE, tracked sessions are gracefully stopped (preserving resume tokens). When you reopen, they're automatically resumed and re-attached to terminal tabs
- **Terminal integration** — sessions open in the IDE's built-in terminal. The tab stays open on errors so you can see what went wrong

### Build from source

**JetBrains** (requires Java 17+):

```bash
cd tools/jetbrains/be-conductor-plugin
./gradlew buildPlugin
# → build/distributions/be-conductor-plugin-0.2.0.zip
```

**VS Code**:

```bash
cd tools/vscode/be-conductor-vscode
npx @vscode/vsce package
# → be-conductor-launcher-0.1.0.vsix
```
